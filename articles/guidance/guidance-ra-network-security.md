# Protecting the cloud boundary in Azure

[!INCLUDE [pnp-header](../../includes/guidance-pnp-header-include.md)]

An on-premises network can be connected to a virtual network in Azure by using an Azure VPN gateway. The network boundary between these two environments can expose areas of weakness in terms of security, and it is necessary to protect this boundary to block unauthorized requests. Similar protection is required for applications running on VMs in Azure that are exposed to the public Internet.

The patterns & practices group has created a set of reference architectures to address these scenarios. Each reference architecture demonstrates one approach to protecting the network boundary, and includes:

* Recommendations and best practices.
* Considerations for availability, security, scalability, and manageability.
* An Azure Resource Manager template that you can modify and deploy. 

## Using a DMZ between Azure and on-premises datacenters

This architecture shows how to create a DMZ (also known as a perimeter network) to filter traffic between Azure and your on-premises network. The DMZ consists of a set of network virtual appliances (NVAs) that can perform tasks such as acting as a firewall, inspecting network packets, and denying access to suspicious requests. These NVAs are implemented as Azure VMs.

## Using a DMZ between Azure and the Internet

This architecture builds on the previous one, but adds a second DMZ to filter traffic between Azure and the Internet.
