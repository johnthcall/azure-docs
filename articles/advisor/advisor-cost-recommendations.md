# Advisor Cost recommendations

Advisor helps you optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources. You can get cost recommendations from the **Cost** tab in the Advisor dashboard.

## Low utilization virtual machines 

While certain application scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of virtual machines. Advisor monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 days and identifies low utilization virtual machines. Virtual machines whose CPU utilization is 5% or less and network usage is 7 MB or less for four or more days, are considered as low utilization virtual machines.

Advisor shows you the estimated cost of continuing to run the virtual machine. You can choose to shut down or resize the virtual machine.

## SQL Elastic database pool recommendations

Advisor identifies SQL server instances that can benefit from creating elastic database pools. Elastic database pools provide a simple cost effective solution to manage the performance goals for multiple databases that have varying usage patterns. For more information about Azure elastic pools, see [What is an Azure Elastic pool?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-pool/)
