# Enterprise integration with X12

## Prereqs
Before you can exchange X12 messages, you need to create an X12 agreement and store it in your integration account. The following steps walk you through the process of creating an X12 agreement.

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) defined in your Azure subscription  
* At least two [partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) configured with EDI X12 qualifier under business identities.   
* Required [Schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to be uploaded to [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-accounts.md)

## Create an X12 agreement
After you log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"):  

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal")
2. Select **More services**, and enter **integration** in the filter search box. Select **Integration Accounts** from the results list:    
![](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements/overview-1.png)    
3. Select the integration account to add the certificate:    
![](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview/overview-3.png)   
4. Select the **Agreements** tile. If you don't see the agreements tile, add it:     
![](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements/agreement-1.png)   
5. Select the **Add** button in the Agreements blade that opens.   
![](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements/agreement-2.png)     
6. Enter a **Name** for your agreement then select the **Agreement type**, **Host Partner**, **Host Identity**,  **Guest Partner**, **Guest Identity**, in the Agreements blade that opens.    
![](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/x12-1.png)  

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name |Name of the agreement |
| Agreement Type | Should be X12 |
| Host Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The host partner represents the organization that is configuring the agreement |
| Host Identity |An identifier for the host partner |
| Guest Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The guest partner represents the organization that's doing business with the host partner |
| Guest Identity |An identifier for the guest partner |
| Receive Settings |These properties apply to all messages received by an agreement |
| Send Settings |These properties apply to all messages sent by an agreement |  

> [!NOTE]
> Resolution of X12 agreement depends on matching the sender qualifier and identifier, and the receiver qualifier and identifier defined in the partner and incoming message.  If there are changes to these values at partner, edit the agreement as well.
>

## Receive Settings

1. Select **Receive Settings** to configure how messages received via this agreement are to be handled.  
2. The Receive Settings control is divided into the following sections, including Identifiers, Acknowledgment, Schemas, Envelopes, Control Numbers, Validations, and Internal Settings. Configure these properties based on your agreement with the partner you are exchanging messages with. Here is a view of these controls, configure them based on how you want this agreement to identify and handle incoming messages  

### Identifiers

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ISA1 (Authorization Qualifier) |Select the Authorization qualifier value from the drop-down list. |
| ISA2 |Optional. Enter Authorization information value. If the value you entered for ISA1 is other than 00, enter a minimum of one alphanumeric character and a maximum of 10. |
| ISA3 (Security Qualifier) |Select the Security qualifier value from the drop-down list. |
| ISA4 |Optional. Enter the Security information value. If the value you entered for ISA3 is other than 00, enter a minimum of one alphanumeric character and a maximum of 10. |

| Include AK2/IK2 Loop |Enables generation of AK2 loops in functional acknowledgments for accepted transaction sets |


### Schemas
Choose a schema for each transaction type (ST1) and Sender Application (GS2). The receive pipeline disassembles the incoming message by matching the values for ST1 and GS2 in the incoming message with the values you set here, and the schema of the incoming message with the schema you set here.

| Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend transaction sets on error|Parses each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document by applying the appropriate envelope to the transaction set. Suspends only those transaction where the validation fails |
| Split Interchange as transaction sets - suspend interchange on error|Parses each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document by applying the appropriate envelope. Suspends entire interchange if one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation | 
| Preserve Interchange - suspend transaction sets on error |Leaves the interchange intact, creates an XML document for the entire batched interchange. Suspends only those transaction sets that fail validation, while continuing to process all other transaction sets |
