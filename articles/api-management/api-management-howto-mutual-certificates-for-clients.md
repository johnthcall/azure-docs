# How to secure APIs using client certificate authentication in API Management

API Management provides the capability to secure access to APIs (i.e., client to API Management) using client certificates. Currently, you can check the thumbprint of a client certificate against a desired value. You can also check the thumbprint against existing certificates uploaded to API Management.  

For information about securing access to the back-end service of an API using client certificates (i.e., API Management to back-end), [How to secure back-end services using client certificate authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates)

## Checking a thumbprint against a desired value

Below policies can be configured to check the thumbprint of a client certificate:

```
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint != "desired-thumbprint-to-validate")" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="401" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>

```

## Checking a thumbprint against certificates uploaded to API Management

The following example shows how to check the thumbprint of a client certificate against certificates uploaded to API Management: 

```
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Deployment.Certificates.Any(c => c.Value.Thumbprint == context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint))" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="401" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>

```
