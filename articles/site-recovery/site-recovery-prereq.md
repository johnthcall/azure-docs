#  Prerequisites for replication to Azure using Azure Site Recovery

 Site Recovery is an Azure service that contributes to your BCDR strategy by orchestrating replication of on-premises physical servers and virtual machines to the cloud (Azure), or to a secondary datacenter. When outages occur in your primary location, you can fail over to a secondary location to keep apps and workloads available. You can failback to your primary location when it returns to normal operations. Learn more in [What is Site Recovery?](site-recovery-overview.md)

This article summarizes the prerequisites required to begin Site Recovery replication to Azure.

## Azure requirements

**Requirement** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Azure account** | A [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) account.<br/><br/> You can start with a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
**Site Recovery service** | [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/site-recovery/) about Site Recovery pricing. |
**Azure storage** | You need an Azure storage account to store replicated data and it must be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault. Replicated data is stored in Azure storage, and Azure VMs are created when failover occurs.<br/><br/> Depending on the resource model you want to use for failed over Azure VMs, you can set up an account in [Resource Manager model](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) or [Classic model](../storage/storage-create-storage-account-classic-portal.md).<br></br>You can use [GRS](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) or LRS storage. We recommend GRS so that data is resilient if a regional outage occurs, or if the primary region can't be recovered.<br/><br/> If you replicate VMware VMs or physical servers in the Azure portal, premium storage is supported. [Premium storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage) is typically used for virtual machines that need a consistently high IO performance, and low latency to host IO intensive workloads. If you use premium storage for replicated data, you also need a standard storage account to store replication logs that capture ongoing changes to on-premises data.<br/><br/>
**Storage limitations** | You can't move storage accounts used in Site Recovery across resource groups, within or across subscriptions.<br/><br/> Replicating to premium storage accounts in Central India and South India isn't currently supported.
**Azure network** | You need an Azure network to which Azure VMs will connect to, after failover and it must be in the same region as the Recovery Services vault.<br/><br/> In the Azure portal, you can create networks in the [Resource Manager model](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md) or [classic model](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-pportal.md).<br/><br/> If you replicate from VMM to Azure, you will set up [network mapping](site-recovery-network-mapping.md) between VMM VM networks and Azure networks, to ensure that Azure VMs connect to appropriate networks after failover.
**Network limitations** | You can't move network accounts used in Site Recovery across resource groups, within or across subscriptions.
**Network mapping** | If you replicate Hyper-V VMs in VMM clouds, you need to set up [network mapping](site-recovery-network-mapping.md), so that Azure VMs are connected to appropriate networks when they're created after failover.

## Disaster Recovery of Hyper-V virtual machines in VMM clouds to a customer owned site

Below are the required components that are needed for disaster recovery of Hyper-V virtual machines in VMM clouds to a customer owned site, in addition to the ones mentioned [above.](#Azure requirements)

| **Components** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **VMM** |  We recommend you deploy a VMM server in the primary site and a VMM server in the secondary site.<br/><br/> You can [replicate between clouds on a single VMM server](site-recovery-single-vmm.md). To do this you need at least two clouds configured on the VMM server.<br/><br/> VMM servers should be running **at least System Center 2012 SP1** with the latest updates.<br/><br/> Each VMM server must have at least one or more clouds. All clouds must have the Hyper-V Capacity profile set. <br/><br/>Clouds must contain one or more VMM host groups. [Learn more](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn469075.aspx#BKMK_Fabric) about setting up VMM clouds.<br/><br/> VMM servers need internet access. |
| **Hyper-V** | Hyper-V servers must be running **at least Windows Server 2012 with the Hyper-V role**, and have the latest updates installed.<br/><br/> A Hyper-V server should contain one or more VMs.<br/><br/>  Hyper-V host servers should be located in host groups in the primary and secondary VMM clouds.<br/><br/> If you run Hyper-V in a cluster on Windows Server 2012 R2, you should install [update 2961977](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2961977)<br/><br/> If you run Hyper-V in a cluster on Windows Server 2012, note that cluster broker isn't created automatically if you have a static IP address-based cluster. You need to configure the cluster broker manually. [Read more](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/18792.configure-replica-broker-role-cluster-to-cluster-replication.aspx). |
| **Provider** | During Site Recovery deployment, you install the Azure Site Recovery Provider on VMM servers. The Provider communicates with Site Recovery over HTTPS 443, to orchestrate replication. Data replication occurs between the primary and secondary Hyper-V servers, over the LAN or a VPN connection.<br/><br/> The Provider running on the VMM server needs access to these URLs:<br/><br/>[!INCLUDE [site-recovery-URLS](../../includes/site-recovery-URLS.md)] <br/><br/>Allow firewall communication from the VMM servers to the [Azure datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=41653) and allow the HTTPS (443) protocol. |
