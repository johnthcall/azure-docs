## Support for Azure VMs

You can deploy Site Recovery to replicate virtual machines and physical servers, running any operating system supported by Azure. This includes most versions of Windows and Linux. On-premises VMs that you want to replicate must conform with Azure requirements.

**Feature** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Hyper-V host** | Should be running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later | Prerequisites check will fail if operating system unsupported
**VMware hypervisor** | Supported operating system | [Check requirements](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#before-you-start-deployment)
**Guest operating system** | Hyper-V to Azure replication: Site Recovery supports all operating systems that are [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868%28v=ws.10%29.aspx). <br/><br/> For VMware and physical server replication: Check the Windows and Linux [prerequisites](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#before-you-start-deployment) | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Guest operating system architecture** | 64-bit | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk size** | Up to 1023 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk count** | 1 | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Data disk count** | 16 or less (maximum value is a function of the size of the virtual machine being created. 16 = XL) | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Data disk VHD size** | Up to 1023 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Network adapters** | Multiple adapters are supported |
**Static IP address** | Supported | If the primary virtual machine is using a static IP address you can specify the static IP address for the virtual machine that will be created in Azure.<br/><br/> Static IP address for a **Linux VM running on Hyper-V** isn't supported.
**iSCSI disk** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Shared VHD** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**FC disk** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Hard disk format** | VHD <br/><br/> VHDX | Although VHDX isn't currently supported in Azure, Site Recovery automatically converts VHDX to VHD when you fail over to Azure. When you fail back to on-premises the virtual machines continue to use the VHDX format.
**Bitlocker** | Not supported | Bitlocker must be disabled before protecting a virtual machine.
**VM name** | Between 1 and 63 characters. Restricted to letters, numbers, and hyphens. Should start and end with a letter or number | Update the value in the virtual machine properties in Site Recovery
**VM type** | Generation 1<br/><br/> Generation 2 - Windows | Generation 2 VMs with an OS disk type of basic, which includes one or two data volumes formatted as VHDX and less than 300 GB are supported.<br/><br/>. Linux Generation 2 VM's aren't supported. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/04/28/disaster-recovery-to-azure-enhanced-and-were-listening/) |
