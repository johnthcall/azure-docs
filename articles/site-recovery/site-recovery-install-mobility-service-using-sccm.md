# Automate Mobility Service installation using software deployment tools

This article provides you an example of how you can use System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) to deploy the Azure Site Recovery Mobility Service in your datacenter. Using a software deployment tool like SCCM gives you the following advantages
* Scheduling deployment -fresh installs and upgrades, during your planned maintenance window for software updates.
* Deploy at scale to hundreds of servers simultaneously


> [!NOTE]
> This article uses System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2 to demonstrate the deployment activity. You could also automate Mobility Service Installation using [Azure Automation and Desired State Configuration](site-recovery-automate-mobility-service-install.md) .

## Prerequisites
1. A software deployment tool like System Center Configuration Manager(SCCM) that is already deployed in your environment.
  * Create two [Device Collections](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg682169.aspx) one for all **Windows Servers** and another for all **Linux Servers** you want to protect using Azure Site Recovery.
3. A Configuration Server that is already registered with Azure Site Recovery.
4. A secure network file share (SMB share) that can be accessed by the SCCM Server.

## Deploy Mobility Service on computers running Microsoft Windows Operating Systems
> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes the following
> 1. The IP Address of the configuration server is 192.168.3.121
> 2. The secure network file share is \\\ContosoSecureFS\MobilityServiceInstallers

### Step 1: Prepare for deployment
1. Create a folder on the network share and name it as **MobSvcWindows**
2. Log on to your Configuration Server and open up an Administrative command prompt
3. Run the following commands to generate a passphrase file.

    `cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\bin`

    `genpassphrase.exe -v > MobSvc.passphrase`
6. Copy the MobSvc.passphrase file into the MobSvcWindows folder on your network share.
5. Next browse to the installer repository on the Configuration Server by running the command.

  `cd %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\puhsinstallsvc\repository`
6. Copy the **Microsoft-ASR\_UA\_*version*\_Windows\_GA\_*date*\_Release.exe** to the **MobSvcWindows** folder on your network share.
7. Copy the code listed below and save it as **install.bat** into the **MobSvcWindows** folder
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to replace the [CSIP] place holders in the below script with the actual values of the IP Address of your Configuration Server.

  [!INCLUDE [site-recovery-sccm-windows-script](../../includes/site-recovery-sccm-windows-script.md)]

### Step 2: Create a Package

1. Log in to your System Center Configuration Manager Console
2. Browse to **Software Library** > **Application Management** > **Packages**
3. Right-click the **Packages** and select **Create Package**
4. Provide values for the Name, Description, Manufacturer, Language, Version.
5. Tick the **This package contains source files** checkbox.
6. Click the **Browse** button and select the network share where the installer is stored (\\\ContosoSecureFS\MobilityServiceInstaller\MobSvcWindows)

  ![create-sccm-package](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/create_sccm_package.png)

7. In the **Choose the program type that you want to create** page, select **Standard Program**, and click **Next**

  ![create-sccm-package](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm-standard-program.png)
8. In the **Specify information about this standard program** page, provide the following inputs, and click **Next**. (The other inputs can be left to their default values)

  ![sccm-package-properties](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm-program-properties.png)   
| **Parameter Name** | **Value** |
|--|--|
| Name | Install Microsoft Azure Mobility Service (Windows) |
| Command line | install.bat |
| Program can run | Whether or not a user is logged on |
9. In the next page, select the target operating systems. Mobility Service can be installed only on Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2.
  ![sccm-package-properties-page2](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm-program-properties-page2.png)   
10. Complete Next twice to complete the wizard.
> [!NOTE]
> The script supports both new installations of Mobility Service Agents and upgrade/update of already installed Agents.

### Step 3: Deploy the Package
1. In the SCCM Console, right-click your package and select **Distribute Content**
  ![distribute-sccm-package](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm_distribute.png)
2. Select the **[Distribution Points](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg712321.aspx#BKMK_PlanForDistributionPoints)** on to which the packages should be copied over to.
3. Once you complete the wizard, the package starts replicating to the specified distribution points
4. Once the package distribution is done, right-click the package and select **Deploy**
  ![deploy-sccm-package](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm_deploy.png)
5. Select the Widows Server device collection you created in the prerequisites section as the target collection for deployment.

  ![sccm-select-target-collection](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm-select-target-collection.png)
6. In the **Specify the content destination** page, select your **Distribution Points**
7. In the **Specify setting to control how this software is deployed** page, ensure that the purpose is selected as required.

  ![sccm-deploy-select-purpose](./media/site-recovery-install-mobility-service-using-sccm/sccm-deploy-select-purpose.png)
8. Specify a schedule in the **Specify the schedule for this deployment**. Read more about [scheduling packages](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg682178.aspx)

> [!TIP]
> To avoid unnecessary reboots, schedule the package installation during your monthly maintenance window or Software Updates window.

You can monitor the deployment progress using the SCCM console by going to **Monitoring** > **Deployments** > *[your package name]*
