# First look: back up files and folders with Azure Backup using the Resource Manager deployment model
This article explains how to back up your Windows Server (or Windows client) files and folders to Azure with Azure Backup using Resource Manager. It's a tutorial intended to walk you through the basics. If you want to get started using Azure Backup, you're in the right place.

If you want to know more about Azure Backup, read this [overview](backup-introduction-to-azure-backup.md).

Backing up files and folders to Azure requires these activities:

![Step 1](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/step-1.png) Get an Azure subscription (if you don't already have one).<br>
![Step 2](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/step-2.png) Create a Recovery Services vault.<br>
![Step 3](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/step-3.png) Download the necessary files.<br>
![Step 4](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/step-4.png) Install and register the Recovery Services agent.<br>
![Step 5](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/step-5.png) Back up your files and folders.

![How to back up your Windows machine with Azure Backup](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/backup-process.png)

## Get an Azure subscription
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) that lets you access any Azure service.

## Create a recovery services vault
To back up your files and folders, you need to create a Recovery Services vault in the region where you want to store the data. You also need to determine how you want your storage replicated.

### To create a Recovery Services vault
1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Azure subscription.
2. On the Hub menu, click **More services** and in the list of resources, type **Recovery Services** and click **Recovery Services vaults**.

    ![Create Recovery Services Vault step 1](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/open-rs-vault-list.png) <br/>

    If there are recovery services vaults in the subscription, the vaults are listed.
3. On the **Recovery Services vaults** menu, click **Add**.

    ![Create Recovery Services Vault step 2](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/rs-vault-menu.png)

    The Recovery Services vault blade opens, prompting you to provide a **Name**, **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Location**.

    ![Create Recovery Services Vault step 3](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/rs-vault-step-3.png)

4. For **Name**, enter a friendly name to identify the vault.
5. From the **Subscription** menu, choose the subscription you want to use. If you use only one subscription, that subscription appears and you can skip to the next step.
6. Under **Resource group** either:
    - select **Create new** and provide a name for the new resource group.</br>
    or
    - select **Use existing** and choose a resource group from the list of resource groups in the subscription.

7. Click **Location** to select the geographic region for the vault. This choice determines the geographic region where your backup data is sent.
8. Click **Create**.

    The portal will provide messages as the vault is created and deployed. If you don't see your vault listed after it has been completed, click **Refresh**. ![Click Refresh button](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/refresh.png)</br>
    Once the list refreshes, select your vault to open its blade.

### Set storage redundancy for the vault
When you first create a Recovery Services vault you determine how storage is replicated.

1. From the list of Recovery Services vaults, click the new vault to open its blade.
2. In the new vault's blade, click **Backup Infrastructure**.
    The Backup Infrastructure blade opens.
3. In the Backup Infrastructure blade, click **Backup Configuration** to open the **Backup Configuration** blade.

    ![Set the storage configuration for new vault](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/set-storage-configuration.png)
4. Choose the appropriate storage replication option for your vault.

    ![storage configuration choices](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/choose-storage-configuration.png)

    By default, your vault has geo-redundant storage. If you are using Azure as a primary backup storage endpoint, continue using geo-redundant storage. If you are using Azure as a non-primary backup storage endpoint, then choose locally redundant storage, which will reduce the cost of storing data in Azure. Read more about [geo-redundant](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) and [locally redundant](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#locally-redundant-storage) storage options in this [overview](../storage/storage-redundancy.md).

Now that you've created a vault, configure it for backing up files and folders.

## Configure the vault
1. On the Recovery Services vault blade (for the vault you just created), in the Getting Started section, click **Backup**, then on the **Getting Started with Backup** blade, select **Backup goal**.

    ![Open backup goal blade](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/open-backup-settings.png)

    The **Backup Goal** blade opens.

    ![Open backup goal blade](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/backup-goal-blade.png)

2. From the **Where is your workload running?** drop-down menu, select **On-premises**.

    You choose **On-premises** because your Windows Server or Windows computer is a physical machine that is not in Azure.

3. From the **What do you want to backup?** menu, select **Files and folders** , and click **OK**.

    ![Configuring files and folders](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/set-file-folder.png)

    After clicking OK, a checkmark appears next to **Backup goal**, and the **Prepare infrastructure** blade opens.

    ![Backup goal configured, next prepare infrastructure](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/backup-goal-configed.png)

4. On the **Prepare infrastructure** blade, click **Download Agent for Windows Server or Windows Client**.

    ![prepare infrastructure](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/choose-agent-for-server-client.png)

    If you are using Windows Server Essential, then choose to download the agent for Windows Server Essential. A pop-up menu prompts you to run or save MARSAgentInstaller.exe.

    ![MARSAgentInstaller dialog](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/mars-installer-run-save.png)

5. In the download pop-up menu, click **Save**.

    By default, the **MARSagentinstaller.exe** file is saved to your Downloads folder. When the installer has completed, you will see a pop-up asking if you want to run the installer, or open the folder.

    ![prepare infrastructure](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/mars-installer-complete.png)

    You don't need to install the agent yet. You'll do this in an upcoming step after you have downloaded the vault credentials.

6. On the **Prepare infrastructure** blade, click **Download**.

    ![download vault credentials](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/download-vault-credentials.png)

    The vault credentials download to your Downloads folder. After the vault credentials have finished downloading, you'll see a pop-up asking if you want to open or save the credentials. Click **Save**. If you accidentally click **Open**, let the dialog that attempts to open the vault credentials, fail. You cannot open the vault credentials. Proceed to the next step; the vault credentials are in the Downloads folder.   

    ![vault credentials finished downloading](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/vault-credentials-downloaded.png)

## Install and register the agent

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling backup through the Azure portal is coming. At this time, use the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent on-premises to back up your files and folders.
>

1. Locate and double click the **MARSagentinstaller.exe** from the Downloads folder (or other saved location).

    The installer provides a series of messages as it extracts, installs, and registers the Recovery Services agent.

    ![run Recovery Services agent installer credentials](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/mars-installer-registration.png)

2. Complete the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent Setup Wizard. To complete the wizard, you need to:

   * Choose a location for the installation and cache folder.
   * Provide your proxy server info if you use a proxy server to connect to the internet.
   * Provide your user name and password details if you use an authenticated proxy.
   * Provide the downloaded vault credentials
   * Save the encryption passphrase in a secure location.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If you lose or forget the passphrase, Microsoft cannot help recover the backup data. Please save the file in a secure location. It is required to restore a backup.
     >
     >

The agent is now installed and your machine is registered to the vault. You're ready to configure and schedule your backup.

## Back up your files and folders
The initial backup includes two key tasks:

* Schedule the backup
* Back up files and folders for the first time

To complete the initial backup, use the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent.

### To schedule the backup job
1. Open the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent. You can find it by searching your machine for **Microsoft Azure Backup**.

    ![Launch the Azure Recovery Services agent](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/snap-in-search.png)
2. In the Recovery Services agent, click **Schedule Backup**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server backup](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/schedule-first-backup.png)
3. On the Getting started page of the Schedule Backup Wizard, click **Next**.
4. On the Select Items to Backup page, click **Add Items**.
5. Select the files and folders that you want to back up, and then click **Okay**.
6. Click **Next**.
7. On the **Specify Backup Schedule** page, specify the **backup schedule** and click **Next**.

    You can schedule daily (at a maximum rate of three times per day) or weekly backups.

    ![Items for Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/specify-backup-schedule-close.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > For more information about how to specify the backup schedule, see the article [Use Azure Backup to replace your tape infrastructure](backup-azure-backup-cloud-as-tape.md).
   >

8. On the **Select Retention Policy** page, select the **Retention Policy** for the backup copy.

    The retention policy specifies the duration for which the backup will be stored. Rather than just specifying a “flat policy” for all backup points, you can specify different retention policies based on when the backup occurs. You can modify the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly retention policies to meet your needs.
9. On the Choose Initial Backup Type page, choose the initial backup type. Leave the option **Automatically over the network** selected, and then click **Next**.

    You can back up automatically over the network, or you can back up offline. The remainder of this article describes the process for backing up automatically. If you prefer to do an offline backup, review the article [Offline backup workflow in Azure Backup](backup-azure-backup-import-export.md) for additional information.
10. On the Confirmation page, review the information, and then click **Finish**.
11. After the wizard finishes creating the backup schedule, click **Close**.

### To back up files and folders for the first time
1. In the Recovery Services agent, click **Back Up Now** to complete the initial seeding over the network.

    ![Windows Server backup now](./media/backup-try-azure-backup-in-10-mins/backup-now.png)
2. On the Confirmation page, review the settings that the Back Up Now Wizard will use to back up the machine. Then click **Back Up**.
3. Click **Close** to close the wizard. If you do this before the backup process finishes, the wizard continues to run in the background.

After the initial backup is completed, the **Job completed** status appears in the Backup console.
