# Back up Azure VMs to a Recovery Services vault

This article details how to back up Azure VMs (both Resource Manager-deployed and Classic-deployed) to a Recovery Services vault. Most of the work for backing up VMs is the preparation. Before you can back up or protect a VM, you must complete the [prerequisites](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md) to prepare your environment for protecting your VMs. Once you have completed the prerequisites, then you can initiate the backup operation to take snapshots of your VM.


[!INCLUDE [learn about backup deployment models](../../includes/backup-deployment-models.md)]

For more information, see the articles on [planning your VM backup infrastructure in Azure](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md) and [Azure virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-machines/).

## Triggering the backup job
The backup policy associated with the Recovery Services vault defines how often and when the backup operation runs. By default, the first scheduled backup is the initial backup. Until the initial backup occurs, the Last Backup Status on the **Backup Jobs** blade shows as **Warning(initial backup pending)**.

Unless your initial backup is due to begin soon, it is recommended that you run **Back up Now**. The following procedure starts from the vault dashboard. This procedure serves for running the initial backup job after you have completed all prerequisites. If the initial backup job has already been run, this procedure is not available. The associated backup policy determines the next backup job.  

To run the initial backup job:

1. On the vault dashboard, on the **Backup** tile, click **Azure Virtual Machines**. <br/>
    ![Settings icon](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/rs-vault-in-dashboard-backup-vms.png)

    The **Backup Items** blade opens.
2. On the **Backup Items** blade, right-click the vault you want to back up, and click **Backup now**.

    ![Settings icon](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/back-up-now.png)

    The Backup job is triggered. <br/>

3. To view that your initial backup has completed, on the vault dashboard, on the **Backup Jobs** tile, click **Azure virtual machines**.

    ![Backup Jobs tile](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/open-backup-jobs.png)

    The Backup Jobs blade opens.
4. In the **Backup jobs** blade, you can see the status of all jobs.

   > [!NOTE]
   > During the backup operation, the backup extension in each virtual machine flushes all writes and takes a consistent snapshot.
   >
   >

    When the backup job is finished, the status is *Completed*.

## Troubleshooting errors
If you run into issues while backing up your virtual machine, see the [VM troubleshooting article](backup-azure-vms-troubleshoot.md) for help.

## Next steps
Now that you have protected your VM, see the following articles to learn about VM management tasks, and how to restore VMs.
