# Cancel your Azure subscription
You can cancel your Azure subscription as the Account Administrator. After you cancel the subscription, your access to Azure services and resources will end.

Before you cancel your subscription:

* Back up your data. For example, if you're storing data in Azure storage or SQL, download a copy. If you have a virtual machine, save an image of it locally.
* Shut down your services. Go to the [resources page in the management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?flight=1#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fresources), and **Stop** any running virtual machines, applications, or other services.
* Consider migrating your data. See [Move resources to new resource group or subscription](./azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources.md).

If you cancel a paid [Azure Support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), you will still be billed monthly for the rest of the 6-months term.

## Cancel subscription via the Azure portal
1. Log on to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the Account Administrator.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only the  account administrator can cancel subscriptions. For more information about how to find out who is the account administrator of the subscription, see the [Frequently asked questions](billing-subscription-transfer.md#faq).
   >
   >

2. On the Hub menu, select **Subscriptions**.

4. Enter the subscripton name and choose a cancellation reason and click the **Cancel Sub** button at the bottom of the cancel blade.

> [!NOTE]
> It will take up to 10 minutes for the cancellation to be reflected in the portal but billing will be stopped immediately.

## Cancel subscription via the Azure Account Center

5. Click ![checkbutton](./media/billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription/checkbutton.png) to close the dialog window and return to your subscription page.

After you cancel your subscription, we wait 90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or change your mind. For more information, see [Microsoft Trust Center - How we manage your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=822930&clcid=0x409).

## Reactivate subscription
If you canceled your Pay-As-You-Go subscription accidentally, you can [reactivate it in the Accounts Center](billing-subscription-become-disable.md).
