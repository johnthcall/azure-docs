# Associate an Office 365 tenant with an Azure subscription
If you acquired both Azure and Office 365 subscriptions separately in the past, and now you want to be able to access the Office 365 tenant from the Azure subscription, it's easy to do so. This article shows you how.

## Quick guidance
To associate your Office 365 tenant with your Azure subscription, use your Azure account to add your Office 365 tenant, and then associate your Azure subscription with the Office 365 tenant.

## Detailed steps
In this scenario, Kelley Wall is a user who has an Azure subscription under the account kelley.wall@outlook.com. Kelley also has an Office 365 subscription under the account kelley.wall@contoso.onmicrosoft.com. Now Kelley wants to access the Office 365 tenant with the Azure subscription.

### Prerequisites
For the association to work properly, the following prerequisites are necessary:

* You need the credentials of the service administrator of the Azure subscription. Co-administrators cannot execute a subset of the steps. To change your service administrator, see [How to add or change Azure administrator roles](./billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md#how-to-change-service-administrator-for-a-subscription).
* You need the credentials of a global administrator of the Office 365 tenant.
* The email address of the service administrator must not be contained in the Office 365 tenant.
* The email address of the service administrator must not match that of any global administrator of the Office 365 tenant.
* If you are currently using an email address that is both a Microsoft account and an organizational account, temporarily change the service administrator of your Azure subscription to use another Microsoft account. You can create a new Microsoft account at the [Microsoft account signup page](https://signup.live.com/).

### Associate the Office 365 tenant with the Azure subscription
To associate the Office 365 tenant with the Azure subscription, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) with the service administrator credentials.

2. In the left pane, select **ACTIVE DIRECTORY**.

Related scenarios include:

* You already have an Office 365 subscription and are ready for an Azure subscription, but you want to use the existing Office 365 user accounts for your Azure subscription.
* You are an Azure subscriber and want to get an Office 365 subscription for the users in your existing Azure Active Directory instance.
