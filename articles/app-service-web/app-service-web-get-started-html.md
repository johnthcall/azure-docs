# Deploy your first HTML web app to Azure in five minutes (CLI 2.0 Preview)

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [First HTML site](app-service-web-get-started-html.md)
> * [First .NET app](app-service-web-get-started-dotnet.md)
> * [First PHP app](app-service-web-get-started-php.md)
> * [First Node.js app](app-service-web-get-started-nodejs.md)

This tutorial helps you deploy a simple HTML+CSS web app to [Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md).
You can use App Service to create web apps, [mobile app back ends](/documentation/learning-paths/appservice-mobileapps/),
and [API apps](../app-service-api/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform.md).

You will: 

* Create a web app in Azure App Service.
* Deploy HTML and CSS to it.
* See your pages running live in production.
* Update your content the same way you would [push Git commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).

[!INCLUDE [app-service-linux](../../includes/app-service-linux.md)]

## CLI versions to complete the task

You can complete the task using one of the following CLI versions:

- [Azure CLI 1.0](app-service-web-get-started-html-cli-nodejs.md) â€“ our CLI for the classic and resource management deployment models
- [Azure CLI 2.0 (Preview)](app-service-web-get-started-html.md) - our next generation CLI for the resource management deployment model

## Prerequisites
* [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/downloads).
* [Azure CLI 2.0 Preview](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2).
* A Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can 
  [sign up for a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or 
  [activate your Visual Studio subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

> [!NOTE]
> You can [Try App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/app-service/) without an Azure account. Create a starter app and play with
> it for up to an hour--no credit card required, no commitments.

## Deploy a simple HTML site
1. Open a new Windows command prompt, PowerShell window, Linux shell, or OS X terminal. Run `git --version` and `azure --version` to verify that Git and Azure CLI
   are installed on your machine.
   
    ![Test installation of CLI tools for your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started-languages/1-test-tools-2.0.png)
   
    If you haven't installed the tools, see [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) for download links.
2. Log in to Azure like this:
   
        az login
   
    Follow the help message to continue the login process.
   
    ![Log in to Azure to create your first web app](./media/app-service-web-get-started-languages/3-azure-login-2.0.png)

3. Set the deployment user for App Service. You will deploy code using these credentials later.
   
        az appservice web deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>

3. Create a new [resource group](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md). For this first App Service tutorial, you don't really need to know
what it is.

        az group create --location "<location>" --name my-first-app-group

    To see what possible values you can use for `<location>`, use the `az appservice list-locations` CLI command.

3. Create a new "FREE" [App Service plan](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md). For this first App Service tutorial, just 
know that you won't be charged for web apps in this plan.

        az appservice plan create --name my-free-appservice-plan --resource-group my-first-app-group --sku FREE

4. Create a new web app with a unique name in `<app_name>`.

        az appservice web create --name <app_name> --resource-group my-first-app-group --plan my-free-appservice-plan

4. Next, you get the sample HTML site you want to deploy. Change to a working directory (`CD`) and clone the sample app like this:
   
        cd <working_directory>
        git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-html-get-started.git

5. Change to the repository of your sample app. 
   
        cd app-service-web-html-get-started
5. Configure local Git deployment for your App Service web app with the following command:

        az appservice web source-control config-local-git --name <app_name> --resource-group my-first-app-group

    You will get a JSON output like this, which means that the remote Git repository is configured:

        {
        "url": "https://<deployment_user>@<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git"
        }

6. Add the URL in the JSON as a Git remote for your local repository (called `azure` for simplicity).

        git remote add azure https://<deployment_user>@<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/<app_name>.git
   
7. Deploy your sample code to your Azure app like you would push any code with Git. When prompted, use the password you configured earlier.
   
        git push azure master
   
    ![Push code to your first web app in Azure](./media/app-service-web-get-started/5-push-code.png)
   
    If you used one of the language frameworks, you'll see different output. This is because `git push` not only puts code in Azure, but also triggers deployment tasks
    in the deployment engine. If you have any package.json
    (Node.js) or requirements.txt (Python) files in your project (repository) root, or if you have a packages.config file in your ASP.NET project, the deployment
    script restores the required packages for you. You can also [enable the Composer extension](web-sites-php-mysql-deploy-use-git.md#composer) to automatically process composer.json files
    in your PHP app.

Congratulations, you have deployed your app to Azure App Service.

## See your app running live
To see your app running live in Azure, run this command from any directory in your repository:

    azure site browse

## Make updates to your app
You can now use Git to push from your project (repository) root anytime to make an update to the live site. You do it the same way as when you deployed your code
the first time. For example, every time you want to push a new change that you've tested locally, just run the following commands from your project 
(repository) root:

    git add .
    git commit -m "<your_message>"
    git push azure master

## Next steps
Find the preferred development and deployment steps for your language framework:

* [.NET](web-sites-dotnet-get-started.md)
* [PHP](app-service-web-php-get-started.md)
* [Node.js](app-service-web-nodejs-get-started.md)
* [Python](web-sites-python-ptvs-django-mysql.md)
* [Java](web-sites-java-get-started.md)

Or, do more with your first web app. For example:

* Try out [other ways to deploy your code to Azure](web-sites-deploy.md). For example, to deploy from one of your GitHub repositories, simply select
  **GitHub** instead of **Local Git Repository** in **Deployment options**.
* Take your Azure app to the next level. Authenticate your users. Scale it based on demand. Set up some performance alerts. All with a few clicks. See 
  [Add functionality to your first web app](app-service-web-get-started-2.md).
