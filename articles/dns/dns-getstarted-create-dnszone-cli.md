# Create an Azure DNS zone using CLI

This article walks you through the steps to create a DNS zone using the cross-platform Azure CLI, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You can also create a DNS zone using [Azure PowerShell](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone.md) or the [Azure portal](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone-portal.md).

## Create a DNS zone

A DNS zone is created using the `azure network dns zone create` command. To see help for this command, type `azure network dns zone create -h`.

The following example creates a DNS zone called *contoso.com* in the resource group called *MyResourceGroup*. Use the example to create a DNS zone, substituting the values for your own.

```azurecli
azure network dns zone create MyResourceGroup contoso.com
```

## Verify your DNS zone

### View records

Creating a DNS zone also creates the following DNS records:

* The *Start of Authority* (SOA) record. This record is present at the root of every DNS zone.
* The authoritative name server (NS) records. These records show which name servers are hosting the zone. Azure DNS uses a pool of name servers, and so different name servers may be assigned to different zones in Azure DNS. For more information, see [delegate a domain to Azure DNS](dns-domain-delegation.md).

To view these records, use `azure network dns-record-set list`:

```azurecli
azure network dns record-set list MyResourceGroup contoso.com

data:    Minimum TTL                     : 300
data:

```

> [!NOTE]
> Record sets at the root (or *apex*) of a DNS Zone use **@** as the record set name.

### Test name servers

You can test your DNS zone is present on the Azure DNS name servers by using DNS tools such as nslookup, dig, or the `Resolve-DnsName` PowerShell cmdlet.

If you haven't yet delegated your domain to use the new zone in Azure DNS, you need to direct the DNS query directly to one of the name servers for your zone. The name servers for your zone are given in the NS records, as given by `azure network dns record-set list`.

The following example uses 'dig' to query the domain contoso.com using the name servers assigned to the DNS zone. Be sure the substitute the correct values for your zone.

     > dig @ns1-01.azure-dns.com contoso.com
     
     <<>> DiG 9.10.2-P2 <<>> @ns1-01.azure-dns.com contoso.com
    (1 server found)
