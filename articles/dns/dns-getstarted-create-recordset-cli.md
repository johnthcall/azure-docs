This article walks you through the process of creating records and records sets by using the Azure CLI.

## Introduction

Before creating DNS records in Azure DNS, you first need to understand how Azure DNS organizes DNS records into DNS record sets.

[!INCLUDE [dns-about-records-include](../../includes/dns-about-records-include.md)]

For more information about DNS records in Azure DNS, see [DNS zones and records](dns-zones-records.md).

## Create a record set and record

This section describes how to create DNS records in Azure DNS. The examples assume you have already [installed the Azure CLI, signed in, and created a DNS zone](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone-cli.md).

The examples on this page all use the 'A' DNS record type. For other record types and further details on how to manage DNS records and record sets, see [Manage DNS records and record sets by using the Azure CLI](dns-operations-recordsets-cli.md).

## Create a DNS record

To create a DNS record, use the `azure network dns record-set add-record` command. For help, see `azure network dns record-set add-record -h`.

When creating a record, you need to specify the resource group name, zone name, record set name, the record type, and the details of the record being 
created.

If the record set does not already exist, this command creates it for you. If the record set already exists, this command adds the record you specify to the existing record set. 

If a new record set is created, a default time-to-live (TTL) of 3600 is used. For instructions on how to use different TTLs, see [Manage DNS records in Azure DNS using the Azure CLI](dns-operations-recordsets-cli.md).

The following example creates an A record called *www* in the zone *contoso.com* in the resource group *MyResourceGroup*. The IP address of the A record is *1.2.3.4*.

```azurecli
azure network dns record-set add-record MyResourceGroup contoso.com www A -a 1.2.3.4
```

To create a record set in the apex of the zone (in this case, "contoso.com"), use the record name "@", including the quotation marks:

```azurecli
azure network dns record-set add-record MyResourceGroup contoso.com "@" A -a 1.2.3.4
```

The parameters used to specify the record data vary depending on the type of the record. For example, for a record of type "A", you specify the IPv4 address with the parameter `-a <IPv4 address>`. See `azure network dns record-set add-record -h` to list the parameters for other record types. For examples for each record type, see [Manage DNS records and record sets by using the Azure CLI](dns-operations-recordsets-cli.md).


## Verify name resolution

You can test your DNS records are present on the Azure DNS name servers by using DNS tools such as nslookup, dig, or the [Resolve-DnsName PowerShell cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj590781.aspx).

If you haven't yet delegated your domain to use the new zone in Azure DNS, you need to [direct the DNS query directly to one of the name servers for your zone](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone.md#test-name-servers). Be sure the substitute the correct values for your records zone into the command below.

    nslookup
    > set type=A
    > server ns1-01.azure-dns.com
    > www.contoso.com

    Server:  ns1-01.azure-dns.com
    Address:  40.90.4.1

	Name:    www.contoso.com
	Address:  1.2.3.4
