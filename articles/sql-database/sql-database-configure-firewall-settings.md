Server-level firewall rules enable administrators to access a SQL Database server from a specified IP address or range of IP addresses. You can also use server-level firewall rules for users when you have many databases that have the same access requirements, and you don't want to spend time configuring each database individually. Microsoft recommends using database-level firewall rules whenever possible, to enhance security and to make your database more portable. For an overview of SQL Database firewalls, see [Overview of SQL Database firewall rules](sql-database-firewall-configure.md).

> [!Note]
> For information about portable databases in the context of business continuity, see [Authentication requirements for disaster recovery](sql-database-geo-replication-security-config.md).

## Manage existing server-level firewall rules through the Azure portal
Repeat the steps to manage the server-level firewall rules.

* To add the current computer, click Add client IP.
* To add additional IP addresses, type in the Rule Name, Start IP Address, and End IP Address.
* To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule and modify.
* To delete an existing rule, hover over the rule until the X appears at the end of the row. Click X to remove the rule.

Click **Save** to save the changes.
