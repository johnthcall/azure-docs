# Tutorial: Back up and restore an Azure SQL Database using the Azure portal
In this tutorial, you learn how to use the Azure portal to:

- View existing backups of a database
- Restore a database to a previous point in time
- Configure long-term retention of a database backup file in the Azure Recovery Services vault
- Restore a database from the Azure Recovery Services vault

**Time estimate**: This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes to complete (assuming you have already met the prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> You can perform these same tasks in a getting started tutorial by using [PowerShell](sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery-powershell.md).
>

## Prerequisites

* You need an Azure account. You can [open a free Azure account](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 

* You must be able to connect to the Azure portal using an account that is a member of either the subscription owner or contributor role. For more information on role-based access control (RBAC), see [Getting started with access management in the Azure portal](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-what-is.md).

* You have completed the [Get started with Azure SQL Database servers, databases, and firewall rules by using the Azure portal and SQL Server Management Studio](sql-database-get-started.md) or the equivalent [PowerShell version](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md) of this tutorial. If you have not, either complete this prerequisite tutorial or execute the PowerShell script at the end of the [PowerShell version](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md) of this tutorial before continuing.


> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial helps you to learn the content of these learn topics: [SQL Database backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md), [Long-term backup retention](sql-database-long-term-retention.md), and [Recover an Azure SQL database using automated database backups](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md).
>

## View the oldest restore point from the service-generated backups of a database

In this section of the tutorial, you view information about the oldest restore point from the [service-generated automated backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md) of your database. 

1. Open the **SQL database** blade for your database, **sqldbtutorialdb**.

   ![new sample db blade](./media/sql-database-get-started/new-sample-db-blade.png)

2. On the toolbar, click **Restore**.

   ![restore toolbar](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restore-toolbar.png)

3. On the Restore blade, review the oldest restore point.

   ![oldest restore point](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/oldest-restore-point.png)

## Restore a database to a previous point in time

In this section of the tutorial, you restore the database to a new database as of a specific point in time.

1. On the **Restore** blade for the database, review the default name for the new database to which to restore you database to an earlier point in time (the name is the existing database name appended with a timestamp). This name changes to reflect the time you specify in the next few steps.

   ![restored database name](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restored-database-name.png)

2. Click the **calendar** icon in the **Restore point (UTC)** input box.

   ![restore point](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restore-point.png)

2. On the calendar, select a date within the retention period

   ![restore point date](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restore-point-date.png)

3. In the **Restore point (UTC)** input box, specify the time on the selected date to which you wish to restore the data in the database from the automated database backups.

   ![restore point time](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restore-point-time.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >Notice that the database name has changed to reflect the date and time that you selected. Notice also that you cannot change the server to which you are restoring to a specific point in time. To restore to a different server, use [Geo-Restore](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md#recover-using-geo-restore). Finally, notice that you can restore into an [elastic pool](sql-database-elastic-jobs-overview.md) or to a different pricing tier. 
   >

4. Click **OK** to restore your database to an earlier point in time to the new database.

5. On the toolbar, click the notification icon to view the status of the restore job.

   ![restore job progress](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restore-job-progress.png)

6. When the restore job is completed, open the **SQL databases** blade to view the newly restored database.

   ![restored database](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/restored-database.png)

> [!NOTE]
> From here, you can connect to the restored database using SQL Server Management Studio to perform needed tasks, such as to [extract a bit of data from the restored database to copy into the existing database or to delete the existing database and rename the restored database to the existing database name](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md#point-in-time-restore).
>

## Configure long-term retention of automated backups in an Azure Recovery Services vault 

In this section of the tutorial, you [configure an Azure Recovery Services vault to retain automated backups](sql-database-long-term-retention.md) for a period longer than the retention period for your service tier. 


> [!TIP]
> To delete backups, see [Delete long-term retention backups](sql-database-long-term-retention-delete.md).
>

1. Open the **SQL Server** blade for your server, **sqldbtutorialserver**.

   ![sql server blade](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-blade.png)

2. Click **Long-term backup retention**.

   ![long-term backup retention link](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/long-term-backup-retention-link.png)

3. On the **sqldbtutorial - Long-term backup retention** blade, review and accept the preview terms (unless you have already done so - or this feature is no longer in preview).

   ![accept the preview terms](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/accept-the-preview-terms.png)

4. To configure long-term backup retention for the sqldbtutorialdb database, select that database in the grid and then click **Configure** on the toolbar.

7. On the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **Add**.

   ![add new vault link](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/add-new-vault-link.png)
   
8. On the **Recovery Services vault** blade, provide a valid name for the new Recovery Services vault.

   ![new vault name](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/new-vault-name.png)

9. Select your subscription and resource group, and then select the location for the vault. When done, click **Create**.

   ![create new vault](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/create-new-vault.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The vault must be located in the same region as the Azure SQL logical server, and must use the same resource group as the logical server.
   >

10. After the new vault is created, execute the necessary steps to return to the **Recovery services vault** blade.

11. On the **Recovery services vault** blade, click the vault and then click **Select**.

   ![select existing vault](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/select-existing-vault.png)

12. On the **Configure** blade, provide a valid name for the new retention policy, modify the default retention policy as appropriate, and then click **OK**.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/define-retention-policy.png)

13. On the **sqldbtutorial - Long-term backup retention** blade, click **Save** and then click **OK** to apply the long-term backup retention policy to all selected databases.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/save-retention-policy.png)

14. Click **Save** to enable long-term backup retention using this new policy to the Azure Recovery Services vault that you configured.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/enable-long-term-retention.png)

15. After long-term backup retention has been enabled, open the **sqldbtutorialvault** blade (go to **All resources** and select it from the list of resources for your subscription).

   ![view recovery services vault](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/view-recovery-services-vault.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once configured, backups show up in the vault within next seven days. Do not continue this tutorial until backups show up in the vault.
>
