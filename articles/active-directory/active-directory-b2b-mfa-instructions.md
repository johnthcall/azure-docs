# Multi-factor authentication for Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration users

With this Azure AD B2B collaboration public preview refresh, we are introducing the capability for organizations to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) policies for B2B collaboration users also. In this refresh, MFA is always enforced at the resource tenancy.

This means:
1. Admin or Information worker in Company A invites user from company B to an application �Foo� in Company A.
2. Application *Foo* in company A is configured to require MFA on access.
3. When user from company B attempts to access app Foo from company A tenant, they will be asked to complete an MFA challenge as required by company A's MFA policy.
4. User can set up their MFA with company A, choose their MFA option
5. This will work for any identity (Azure AD or MSA for example if users in Company B authenticate using social ID)
6. Company A will need to have adequate premium Azure AD SKUs which support MFA. The user from Company B will consume this license from Company A.
7. In summary, the inviting tenancy is *always* responsible for MFA of B2B collaboration users from the partner organization, not the partner organization itself (even if it has MFA capabilities). In future releases, we will be enabling the inviting organization to trust specific partner organizations' MFA instead of using the inviting organization's MFA.

## Setting up MFA for B2B users
To discover how easy it is to set up MFA for B2B collaboration users, see how in the following video:

## MFA reset for B2B collaboration users
Currently, the admin can require B2B collaboration users to proof up again only by using the following PowerShell cmdlets. Therefore, the following PowerShell cmdlts should be used if you want to reset a B2B user's proof up method.
Note: To use the new cmdlet, you need to install the Azure AD PowerShell V2 module, which you can get from here: https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview
1. Connect to Azure AD
    Connect-AzureAd and login
2. Get all users with proof up methods
    Get-MsolUser | where { $_.StrongAuthenticationMethods} | select UserPrincipalName,
    @{n="Methods";e={($_.StrongAuthenticationMethods).MethodType}}
  Here is an example:
    PS C:\Users\tjwasser> Get-MsolUser | where { $_.StrongAuthenticationMethods} | select UserPrincipalName, @{n="Methods";e
={($_.StrongAuthenticationMethods).MethodType}}

  UserPrincipalName   |   Methods

  AudreyO@WoodGroveOnline.com | {OneWaySMS, TwoWayVoiceMobile, PhoneAppOTP, PhoneApp...
  SaratS@WoodGroveOnline.com|  {OneWaySMS, TwoWayVoiceMobile}

3. Reset the MFA method for a specific user
  You can then use that UserPrincipalName to run the reset command to require the B2B user to set proof-up methods again. Example:
    Reset-MsolStrongAuthenticationMethodByUpn -UserPrincipalName
