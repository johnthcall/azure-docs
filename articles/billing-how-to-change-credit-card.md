2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to add a payment method.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, select “+” to add a credit card.
5. Choose a credit card type, and then provide all the required information.

## Edit payment information for an existing credit card

Follow these steps to verify your payment method and update the details of an existing credit card.

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only the  account administrator has permission to access the Account Center. For more information about the account administrator, see [How to add or change Azure administrator roles](billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md).
   >
   >
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription that is linked to the credit card.</br> ![selectsub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/selectsub.png)
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.</br> ![changesub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/changesub_new.png)

  You will see the current payment method listed. Select it to verify the required information.

  **How to update the details of an existing credit card**

  If your credit card gets renewed and the number remains the same, you can simply update the existing credit card details, such as the expiration date. However, if your credit card number ever changes because the card is lost, stolen or expired, you may have to [add a credit card to your account](#addcard). This is because the CVV security code on the card is changed when the credit card number changes.

4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, select **Edit** next to the credit card number.</br> ![changesub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/editcard_new.png)
5. On the **Edit** page, verify that you have selected the correct credit card type and card number.
6. Make the necessary changes you need to the card details, and then select **Next** to the **Choose payment method** page.

## Change the credit card that you use to pay an Azure bill

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to update the payment method.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, click **Use Instead**, select the credit card that you want to use.

## Remove a credit card from the account
1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to update the payment method.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, click **Delete** to select the credit card you want to delete.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You will not be able to delete a credit card if it is associated with other active Microsoft subscriptions. If you receive an error that the card is in use, please ensure that it is disassociated from all active subscriptions that you have with Microsoft.
