# Extend HDInsight capabilities by using Azure Virtual Network
Azure Virtual Network allows you to extend your Hadoop solutions to incorporate on-premises resources such as SQL Server, combine multiple HDInsight cluster types, or to create secure private networks between resources in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

* Azure CLI 2.0 (preview): See [Install and Configure Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-az-cli2) for more information.

* Azure PowerShell: See [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this document require the latest version of the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. If you are using an older version, the commands may be different. For best results, use the previous links to install the latest versions.

## <a id="whatis"></a>What is Azure Virtual Network?

[Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/) allows you to create a secure, persistent network containing the resources you need for your solution. A virtual network allows you to:

* Connect cloud resources together in a private network (cloud-only).
  
    ![diagram of cloud-only configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/cloud-only.png)
  
    Using Virtual Network to link Azure services with Azure HDInsight enables the following scenarios:
  
    * **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from Azure websites or services running in Azure virtual machines.
    * **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, or another data storage solution running on a virtual machine.
    * **Combining multiple HDInsight servers** into a single solution. HDInsight clusters come in a variety of types, which correspond to the workload or technology that the cluster is tuned for. There is no supported method to create a cluster that combines multiple types, such as Storm and HBase on one cluster. Using a virtual network allows multiple clusters to directly communicate with each other.

* Connect your cloud resources to your local datacenter network (site-to-site or point-to-site) by using a virtual private network (VPN).
  
    Site-to-site configuration allows you to connect multiple resources from your datacenter to the Azure virtual network by using a hardware VPN or the Routing and Remote Access service.
  
    ![diagram of site-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/site-to-site.png)
  
    Point-to-site configuration allows you to connect a specific resource to the Azure virtual network by using software VPN.
  
    ![diagram of point-to-site configuration](media/hdinsight-extend-hadoop-virtual-network/point-to-site.png)
  
    Using Virtual Network to link the cloud and your datacenter enables similar scenarios to the cloud-only configuration. But instead of being limited to working with resources in the cloud, you can also work with resources in your datacenter.
  
    * **Directly transferring data** between HDInsight and your datacenter. An example is using Sqoop to transfer data to or from SQL Server or reading data generated by a line-of-business (LOB) application.
    * **Invoking HDInsight services or jobs** from an LOB application. An example is using HBase Java APIs to store and retrieve data from an HDInsight HBase cluster.

For more information on Virtual Network features, benefits, and capabilities, see the [Azure Virtual Network overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must create the Azure Virtual Network before provisioning an HDInsight cluster. For more information, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-network/).

## Virtual Network requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating an HDInsight cluster on a Virtual Network requires specific Virtual Network configurations, which are described in this section.

### Location-based Virtual networks

Azure HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and does not currently work with virtual networks based on affinity group.

### Classic or v2 Virtual Network

Windows-based clusters require a Classic Virtual Network, while Linux-based clusters require an Azure Resource Manager Virtual Network. If you do not have the correct type of network, it will not be usable when you create the cluster.

If you have resources on a Virtual Network that is not usable by the cluster you plan on creating, you can create a new Virtual Network that is usable by the cluster, and connect it to the incompatible Virtual Network. You can then create the cluster in the network version that it requires, and it will be able to access resources in the other network since the two are joined. For more information on connecting classic and new Virtual Networks, see [Connecting classic VNets to new VNets](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-different-deployment-models-portal.md).

### Custom DNS

When creating a virtual network, Azure provides default name resolution for Azure services such as HDInsight that are installed in the network. However you may need to use your own Domain Name System (DNS) for situations such as cross network domain name resolution. For example, when communicating between services located in two joined virtual networks. HDInsight supports both the default Azure name resolution as well as custom DNS when used with Azure Virtual Network.

For more information on using your own DNS server with Azure Virtual Network, see the **Name resolution using your own DNS server** section of the [Name Resolution for VMs and Role Instances](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-using-your-own-dns-server) document.

### Secured Virtual Networks

The HDInsight service is a managed service, and requires Internet access during provisioning and while running. This is so that Azure can monitor the health of the cluster, initiate failover of cluster resources, change the number of nodes in the cluster through scaling operations, and other management tasks.

If you need to install HDInsight into a secured Virtual Network, you must allow inbound access over port 443 for the following IP addresses, which allow Azure to manage the HDInsight cluster.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The IP addresses that should be allowed are specific to the region that the HDInsight cluster and Virtual Network reside in. Use the following to find the IP addresses for the region you are using.

__Brazil South__ region:

* 191.235.84.104
* 191.235.87.113

__Canada East__ region:

* 52.229.127.96
* 52.229.123.172

__Canada Central__ region:

* 52.228.37.66
* 52.228.45.222

__West Central US__ region:

* 52.161.23.15
* 52.161.10.167

__West US 2__ region:

* 52.175.211.210
* 52.175.222.222

__All other regions__:

* 168.61.49.99
* 23.99.5.239
* 168.61.48.131
* 138.91.141.162

Allowing inbound access from port 443 for these addresses will allow you to successfully install HDInsight into a secured virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HDInsight doesn't support restricting outbound traffic, only inbound traffic. When defining Network Security Group rules for the subnet that contains HDInsight, only use inbound rules.

The following examples demonstrate how to create a new Network Security Group that allows required addresses, and applies the security group to a subnet within your Virtual Network. The addresses used in this example are from the __All other regions__ list above. If you are in one of the regions specifically listed, such as __West Central US__, modify the script to use the IP addresses for your region.

These steps assume that you have already created a Virtual Network and subnet that you want to install HDInsight into.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note the `priority` value used in these examples; rules are tested against network traffic in order by priority. Once a rule matches the test criteria and is applied, no more rules are tested.
> 
> If you have custom rules that broadly block inbound traffic (such as a **deny all** rule), you may need to adjust the priority values in these examples or your custom rules so that the rules in the examples occur before the rules that block access. Otherwise, the **deny all** rule will be tested first and the rules in this example will never apply. You must also take care not block the default rules for an Azure Virtual Network. For example, you should not create a **deny all** rule that is applied before the default **ALLOW VNET INBOUND** rule (which has a priority of 65000.)
> 
> For more information on how rules are applied and the default inbound and outbound rules, see [What is a Network Security Group?](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md).

**Using Azure PowerShell**

    $vnetName = "Replace with your virtual network name"
    $resourceGroupName = "Replace with the resource group the virtual network is in"

        -VirtualNetwork $vnet `
        -Name $subnetName `
        -AddressPrefix $subnet.AddressPrefix `
        -NetworkSecurityGroup $nsg

**Using the Azure CLI**

1. Use the following command to create a new network security group named `hdisecure`. Replace **RESOURCEGROUPNAME** and **LOCATION** with the resource group that contains the Azure Virtual Network and the location (region,) that the group was created in.
   
        az network nsg create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME -n hdisecure -l LOCATION

    Once the group has been created, you will receive information on the new group.

2. Use the following to add rules to the new network security group that allow inbound communication on port 443 from the Azure HDInsight health and management service. Replace **RESOURCEGROUPNAME** with the name of the resource group that contains the Azure Virtual Network.
    
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule1 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "168.61.49.99" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 300 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule2 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "23.99.5.239" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 301 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule3 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "168.61.48.131" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 302 --direction "Inbound"
        az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule4 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "443" --source-address-prefix "138.91.141.162" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 303 --direction "Inbound"

3. Once the rules have been created, use the following to retrieve the unique identifier for this network security group:

        az network nsg show -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME -n hdisecure --query 'id'

    This returns a value similar to the following text:

        "/subscriptions/55b1016c-0f27-43d2-b908-b8c373d6d52e/resourceGroups/mygroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/hdisecure"

4. Using the following command to apply the network security group to a subnet. Replace the __GUID__ and __RESOURCEGROUPNAME__ values with the ones returned from the previous step. Replace __VNETNAME__ and __SUBNETNAME__ with the virtual network name and subnet name that you want to use when creating an HDInsight cluster.
   
        az network vnet subnet update -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --vnet-name VNETNAME --name SUBNETNAME --set networkSecurityGroup.id="/subscriptions/GUID/resourceGroups/RESOURCEGROUPNAME/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/hdisecure"
   
    Once this command completes, you can successfully install HDInsight into the secured Virtual Network on the subnet used in these steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the above steps only opens access to the HDInsight health and management service on the Azure cloud. This allows you to successfully install an HDInsight cluster into the subnet, however access to the HDInsight cluster from outside the Virtual Network is blocked by default. You will have to add additional Network Security Group rules if you wish to enable access from outside the Virtual Network.
> 
> For example, to allow SSH access from the internet, you will need to add a rule similar to the following: 
> 
> * Azure PowerShell - ```Add-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name "SSSH" -Description "SSH" -Protocol "*" -SourcePortRange "*" -DestinationPortRange "22" -SourceAddressPrefix "*" -DestinationAddressPrefix "VirtualNetwork" -Access Allow -Priority 304 -Direction Inbound```
> * Azure CLI - ```az network nsg rule create -g RESOURCEGROUPNAME --nsg-name hdisecure -n hdirule4 --protocol "*" --source-port-range "*" --destination-port-range "22" --source-address-prefix "*" --destination-address-prefix "VirtualNetwork" --access "Allow" --priority 304 --direction "Inbound"```

For more information on Network Security Groups, see [Network Security Groups overview](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md). For information on controlling routing in an Azure Virtual Network, see [User Defined Routes and IP forwarding](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md).

## <a id="tasks"></a>Tasks and information

This section contains information on common tasks and information you may need when using HDInsight with a virtual network.

### Determine the FQDN

The HDInsight cluster will be assigned a specific fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Virtual Network interface. This is the address that you should use when connecting to the cluster from other resources on the virtual network. To determine the FQDN, use the following to URL to query the Ambari management service:

    https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/<servicename>/components/<componentname>

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).

You must specify the cluster name and a service and component running on the cluster, such as the YARN resource manager.

> [!NOTE]
> The data returned is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document that contains a lot of information about the component. To extract just the FQDN, you should use a JSON parser to retrieve the `host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name` value.

For example, to return the FQDN from an HDInsight Hadoop cluster, you can use one of the following methods to retrieve the data for the YARN resource manager:

* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs)
  
        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
        $Username = <cluster admin username>
        $Password = <cluster admin password>
        $DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix
  
        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
  
        $Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/services/yarn/        components/resourcemanager"
        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
        $FQDN = $JsonObject.host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name
        Write-host $FQDN

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
  
        curl -G -u <username>:<password> https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/services/yarn/components/resourcemanager | jq .host_components[0].HostRoles.host_name

### Connecting to HBase

To connect to HBase remotely by using the Java API, you must determine the ZooKeeper quorum addresses for the HBase cluster and specify this in your application.

To get the ZooKeeper quorum address, use one of the following methods to query the Ambari management service:

* [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs)
  
        $ClusterDnsName = <clustername>
        $Username = <cluster admin username>
        $Password = <cluster admin password>
        $DnsSuffix = ".azurehdinsight.net"
        $ClusterFQDN = $ClusterDnsName + $DnsSuffix
  
        $webclient = new-object System.Net.WebClient
        $webclient.Credentials = new-object System.Net.NetworkCredential($Username, $Password)
  
        $Url = "https://" + $ClusterFQDN + "/ambari/api/v1/clusters/" + $ClusterFQDN + "/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum"
        $Response = $webclient.DownloadString($Url)
        $JsonObject = $Response | ConvertFrom-Json
        Write-host $JsonObject.items[0].properties.'hbase.zookeeper.quorum'

* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
  
        curl -G -u <username>:<password> "https://<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/ambari/api/v1/clusters/<clustername>.azurehdinsight.net/configurations?type=hbase-site&tag=default&fields=items/properties/hbase.zookeeper.quorum" | jq .items[0].properties[]

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on using Ambari with HDInsight, see [Monitor Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Ambari API](hdinsight-monitor-use-ambari-api.md).

Once you have the quorum information, use it in your client application.

For example, for a Java application that uses the HBase API, you would add an **hbase-site.xml** file to the project and specify the quorum information in the file as follows:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>zookeeper0.address,zookeeper1.address,zookeeper2.address</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort</name>
    <value>2181</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

### Verify network connectivity

Some services, such as SQL Server, can limit incoming network connections. This will prevent HDInsight from successfully working with these services.

If you encounter problems accessing a service from HDInsight, consult the documentation for the service to ensure that you have enabled network access. You can also verify network access by creating an Azure virtual machine on the same virtual network, and use client utilities to verify that the virtual machine can connect to the service over the virtual network.
