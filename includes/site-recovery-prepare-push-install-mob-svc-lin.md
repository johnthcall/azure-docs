### Prepare for push install on Linux Servers

1. Ensure thereâ€™s network connectivity between the Linux machine and the process server.
2. Create an account that can be used by the process server to access the machine. The account should be a **root** user on the source Linux server() this account is only used for the push installation/updates).
3. Check that the `/etc/hosts` file on the source Linux server contains entries that map the local hostname to IP addresses associated with all network adapters.
4. Install the latest openssh, openssh-server, openssl packages on the machine you want to replicate.
5. Ensure SSH is enabled and running on port 22.
6. Enable SFTP subsystem and password authentication in the sshd_config file as follows:
  - Log in as **root**.
  - In the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, find the line that begins with **PasswordAuthentication**.
  - Uncomment the line and change the value from **no** to **yes**.
   6.4 Find the line that begins with **Subsystem** and uncomment the line.

7. Add the account you created in the CSPSConfigtool.

    - Log in to your Configuration Server.
    - Open **cspsconfigtool.exe**. (It's available as a shortcut on the desktop and under the %ProgramData%\home\svsystems\bin folder)
    - In the **Manage Accounts** tab, click **Add Account**.
    - Add the account you created. After adding the account, you need to provide the credentials when you enable replication for a machine.
